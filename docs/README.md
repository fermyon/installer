# The Fermyon Platform website

**The Fermyon Platform documentation website is deprecated.** We still run it, but only to redirect to new documentation at Fermyon's [Developer site](https://developer.fermyon.com/)

## Running locally with Spin

To build and run the website:

1. Install and configure [Spin](https://spin.fermyon.dev).

2. Run `spin up`

3. View documentation website at http://localhost:3000
